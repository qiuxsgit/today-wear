## Why Today Wear?

Many outfit or fashion apps focus on social feeds, recommendations,
or require user accounts and cloud sync.

Today Wear is different.

It is designed as a **personal outfit diary**,
especially for users who simply want to remember their daily outfits
without pressure, algorithms, or data collection.
